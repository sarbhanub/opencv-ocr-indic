#   OCR for Indic-Languages

## Introduction
An approach to use **OpenCV** and Google's **Tesseract** to do OCR in Python.

**Other Libraries:** PyTesseract (Python-tesseract is a python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR), NumPy, Pillow. 

*   **Tesseract Documentation**
    *    Original Repository: **Tesseract at UB Mannheim** [link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
    *    The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform OCR (optical character recognition) of historical German newspapers (Allgemeine Preu√üische Staatszeitung, Deutscher Reichsanzeiger). The latest results with OCR from more than 360,000 scans are available online.
*    **OpenCV Documentation:** [link](https://docs.opencv.org/)
## Deployment

*   I used PyCharm for most of this. Also can be deployed using JupyterLab & Notebooks.
*   Use appropriate functions for viewing data, as the consoles in Notebook won't support OpenCV's 'imshow()' function.
